## Description
A Modern E-Commerce Platform is a full-featured online shopping system designed to provide a seamless user experience for customers and an efficient management system for administrators. The platform will support product browsing, cart management, secure checkout, order tracking, and an admin dashboard for inventory and user management. This project will apply software engineering principles, UML modeling, round-trip engineering, version control, and testing practices as outlined in the course.

## Core Features
- User Registration & Authentication
- Product Catalog with Search & Filtering
- Shopping Cart & Checkout Process
- Payment Gateway Integration (Simulated)
- Order History & Tracking
- Admin Dashboard for Product/Order/User Management

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Modeling: Enterprise Architect (UML Diagrams)
- Version Control: Git & GitHub
- Backend Language: Java
- Testing: JUnit
- Documentation: Markdown, Diagrams (PNG), Reports
- Collaboration: GitHub Projects, Pull Requests, Code Reviews

## 📅 Project Scope & Feasibility
- We will use simulated data and payment processing for prototyping.
- The project is modular and can be developed incrementally.
- Each phase aligns with the course deliverables (UML, EA, GitHub collaboration, testing).

## Expected Deliverables
1. Phase 1: GitHub repo setup, proposal, team formation
2. Phase 2: Requirements doc, Use Case, Activity, Sequence diagrams
3. Phase 3: Class Diagram, forward/reverse engineering in EA, generated Java code
4. Phase 4: Collaborative implementation using Git branch/PR workflow
5. Phase 5: HLD & LLD documentation
6. Phase 6: JUnit test suite
7. Final: Complete repository with all phases documented and codebase.

## ✅ Alignment with Course Objectives
- Analysis: Identify actors and requirements
- Design: UML diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, Class)
- Tooling: Enterprise Architect for modeling and round-trip engineering
- Collaboration: GitHub for version control and team workflow
- Testing: JUnit for unit testing
